Parts of the work are derived/rewritten from the aerogear-otp project. 

I have rewritten a lot of the parts completely. The API is nearly equal to the original one.

I have added further OTP implementations and unit tests, which were not accepted by the original project itself.

That's why I have decided to rewrite and publish it.


Implementations:
- Totp is now a real TOTP (in aerogear it is a google compatible TOTP)
- GTotp is the original implementation created in the aerogear project (was refactored majorly)
- Motp is compatible with Apps like iOTP and supports MOTPs (google for motp or http://motp.sourceforge.net)
	- no work was derived from source forge
